Step 1: Data Visualization

Create a Single Page Application with only one view that shows a visualization of information regarding Near-Earth-Objects travelling around the earth. You will use the Data returned by the following API call: â€‹https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/browse?api_key=DEMO_KEY 
This data can be added in your code locally, there is no need to fetch it from the API in step 1. 

Display a non-Stacked Bar Chart, with 2 Bars for each Near Earth Object from the API representing their min and max estimated diameter, sorted by average estimated diameter descending.
